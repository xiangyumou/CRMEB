/**
 * The payment domain's public surface.
 *
 * `docs/conventions.md`: a domain in `core` may import another domain only
 * through its `index.ts`. So this file is the contract between payment and
 * everybody else, and `payment.repo.ts` in particular is private — nothing
 * outside this folder may write a `payment_attempts` row.
 *
 * ## What other domains call
 *
 * | Function                | Caller | When                                            |
 * | ----------------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
 * | `closeOrderPayments`    | order  | **before** cancelling an order, outside the tx  |
 * | `ensureNoOpenAttempts`  | order  | inside the cancelling transaction (the port)    |
 * | `settlePayment`         | itself | the one place money becomes state               |
 * | `payClient`             | refund | the gateway client, already configured          |
 * | `recordCallback`        | refund | the refund webhook's idempotency insert         |
 * | `applyExceptionRefundNotification` | refund | a refund notification with an `X` number |
 *
 * The cancel path is two calls, not one, and the order matters. The port may
 * not make a network call — it runs inside a transaction with the order row
 * locked — so it can only report what the database already knows. The order
 * domain therefore calls `closeOrderPayments(ctx, orderId)` first, outside the
 * transaction, and only proceeds to cancel if it answered `closed`. `paid`
 * means the money arrived and the order is now paid; `unknown` means the
 * gateway did not answer, and **nothing may be released** — not stock, not the
 * coupon (QUEUE-003 / QUEUE-004).
