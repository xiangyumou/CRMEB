/**
 * What the group-buy domain does *after* the transaction commits.
 *
 * Anything that calls a third party happens after commit, via the effects
 * ledger — never inside the transaction. A notification sent inside it would
 * let a WeChat timeout roll back a team that had genuinely completed, so there
 * is no flag to opt in: every notification is an effect, always.
 *
 * Four event types, recorded in `groupbuy.order.ts` and `groupbuy.jobs.ts` —
 * and `groupbuy.settle` also by 立即成团 (`groupbuy.service.ts`):
 *
 * | scope      | event_type         | when                                        |
 * | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
 * | `order`    | `groupbuy.join`    | a paid order took a seat                    |
 * | `groupbuy` | `groupbuy.settle`  | a team succeeded or failed                  |
 * | `order`    | `groupbuy.refund`  | the shop owes money nobody asked it for     |
 * | `groupbuy` | `groupbuy.expire`  | a team's clock ran out (delayed)            |
 *
 * The first three are also where the shopper hears about it — see
 * `groupbuy.notifications.ts` for which message each one sends.
 *
 * `groupbuy.expire` is the timer, and it is an effect rather than a delayed
 * queue job for the reason the checkout service states about `order.autoCancel`:
 * a queue is not transactional, and an enqueue inside the transaction that
 * created the team can be delivered before — or without — the row it names. The
 * effects ledger is written in that same transaction and `run_at` carries the
 * delay, so the timer exists exactly when the team does.

/**
 * How a failed team gives the money back.
 *
 * The default is `refundSystemInitiated` from `refund/index.ts`. The port
 * exists because a unit test that wants to watch the effect handler should not
 * have to stand up a paid order, a payment attempt and a refundable line;
 * `registerAutoRefundPort` lets it substitute a spy.
 *
 * What it is *not* is an extension point: the only registration outside a test
 * is the default below, and anything that opens a `refunds` row still goes
 * through the refund domain's own entry point, ceiling check and all.

 * roll back the other four. The ledger's `UNIQUE (scope, scope_id,
 * event_type)` gives exactly one effect per member's order however many sweeps
 * run, and `refundSystemInitiated` is idempotent per `(orderId, reason)` on top
 * of that, so a retried effect finds the refund it already opened and returns
 * it instead of opening a second.
 *
 * The 拼团失败 notice is recorded in the same transaction, so it exists exactly
 * when the refund does and can say the money is on its way.
 *
 * A throw here is still the right failure: the dispatcher retries eight times
 * and then parks the row as `unknown`, where the 待处理任务 console lists it
 * (it filters `scope in ('payment','refund','order')`, and this effect's scope
 * is `order`) and an operator settles it by hand. Swallowing the error would
 * lose a shopper's money quietly.
