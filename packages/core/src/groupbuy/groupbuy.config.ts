/**
 * 拼团设置.
 *
 * There is no 虚拟成团 switch any more (decided 2026-09-23). The mini-program
 * is the only storefront after the cutover, and a team completed with invented
 * members reads as a fake transaction there (WeChat 运营规范 3.2.5), so a team
 * that does not fill by its deadline fails and every paid member is refunded.
 * The old `virtualFillOnExpiry` key is not in the schema, so a stored value is
 * dropped on read; migration `0005_groupbuy_virtual_fill_off` deletes it too,
 * which keeps it off if an upgrade rolls back to an image that still reads it.
 *
 * The group declares the *read* atom, as every config group does; the settings
 * service derives the write gate from it (`writePermissionFor`), so seeing this
 * form needs `groupbuy:activity:read` and saving it needs
 * `groupbuy:activity:write`. "May we fake teams" is not a setting a 运营
 * assistant should be able to flip.
