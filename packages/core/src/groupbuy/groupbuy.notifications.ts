/**
 * What a group-buy shopper is told, and when.
 *
 * | code                 | sent by                         | to                          |
 * | -------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
 * | `groupbuy_created`   | the `groupbuy.join` effect      | a leader whose seat is paid |
 * | `groupbuy_joined`    | the `groupbuy.join` effect      | a member whose seat is paid |
 * | `groupbuy_succeeded` | the `groupbuy.settle` effect    | every paid member           |
 * | `groupbuy_failed`    | the `groupbuy.refund` effect    | each member being refunded  |
 *
 * The codes are the ones the reference-data seed already writes shells for, so
 * 通知管理 shows one row per event rather than a seeded row nobody sends and a
 * registered one beside it.
 *
 * `groupbuy_failed` is sent by the refund, not by the settle: a shopper whose
 * team failed is told in the same transaction that opens their refund, so the
 * message can say the money is on its way and never arrives for a refund that
 * rolled back. It also covers the shopper who paid for a seat somebody else took
 * a moment earlier, whose team did not fail at all but who is owed the same
 * news.
 *
 * Links open the uni-app pages: the 拼团 page takes the group id, the order page
 * the order number (`order_id` is the number the pages print and route on).
