/**
 * The `wechat-oa` domain: everything an operator manages about the Official
 * Account, plus the callback WeChat talks to.
 *
 * ## Why this is a sibling of `wechat` and not a folder inside it
 *
 * `boundaries/no-restricted-source` resolves a cross-domain import against
 * `<domain>/index.ts`, so a nested `wechat/oa/` would either be unreachable
 * from other domains or force `wechat`'s own index to re-export half of this
 * file; `wechat` is flat for the same reason. This domain imports the WeChat
 * client through `../wechat` and nothing else.
 *
 * ## What other domains may use
 *
 * Almost nothing, deliberately. The admin services are for the route files;
 * the webhook service is for the two bare route handlers. The one genuinely
 * shared thing is `wechatOaPermissions`, which the role editor needs.
