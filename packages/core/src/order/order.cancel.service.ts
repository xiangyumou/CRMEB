/**
 * Cancellation — the user's, the timeout's and the admin's — behind **one**
 * entry point.
 *
 * Three entry points would each grow their own idea of what to give back; the
 * one that forgot the coupon would let a timed-out order quietly eat it.
 *
 * The order of operations is the whole safety argument:
 *
 *  0. **outside** any transaction, `PaymentPort.closeOrderPayments` asks the
 *     gateway to close every open attempt: `closed` proceeds, `paid` refuses,
 *     `unknown` refuses and releases *nothing* (never guess). It is outside
 *     because it talks to WeChat, and a row lock held for the length of a
 *     gateway round trip is how a checkout table seizes up;
 *  1. `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` on the order, so a payment cannot start underneath;
 *  2. ask `PaymentPort` *again*, **while holding it** — `ensureNoOpenAttempts`
 *     is database-only and this is the re-check that catches an attempt opened
 *     between step 0 and the lock. Same three answers, same three outcomes;
 *  3. one conditional `pending_payment -> cancelled` transition. Exactly one
 *     caller can win it, which is what makes the auto-cancel job and the user's
 *     tap safe to race;
 *  4. only the winner gives back the stock and the coupon, in the same
 *     transaction, so QUEUE-006's "both or neither" holds by construction.
 *
 * Steps 0 and 2 are the payment port's two-call protocol. Without step 0, every
 * order whose buyer had opened the WeChat sheet and backed out would answer
 * `unknown` forever: the 取消订单 button would refuse them and the sweep would
 * skip exactly the orders it exists for.
 *
 * A paid order is never cancelled — `ORDER_TRANSITIONS` has no such edge. It
 * leaves through the refund domain's full refund.
