/**
 * The cross-domain seams of the order aggregate.
 *
 * Several domains touch an order without owning it: payment and refund,
 * fulfilment, group-buy and presale, catalog stock, freight. If they reached
 * into each other's tables every change to one would ripple through the others,
 * so this file is the *only* thing they share.
 *
 * Everything here is an interface, a type, or a registry. There is no
 * behaviour: the implementations are registered by their owning domain
 * (`registerStockPort` from catalog, `registerPaymentPort` from payment, …) and
 * the fakes for tests live in `@shop/testing`.
 *
 * Rules that are not negotiable:
 *  - a transition is a **conditional update**, decided on the affected row
 *    count, never a read-then-write, so two concurrent requests (a
 *    double-tapped 收货, two operators shipping the same order) cannot both win;
 *  - hooks run **inside** the caller's transaction and may only touch the
 *    database — anything that calls a third party records an effect instead
 *    (`docs/conventions.md`: "never inside the transaction");
 *  - hooks must be **idempotent**, because the effect ledger retries.
