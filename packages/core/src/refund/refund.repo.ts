 * Two rules from the schema shape almost every statement here:

 *  - **`refund_items.is_open` mirrors the parent status**, and the partial
 *    unique index `refund_items(order_item_id) WHERE is_open` is what makes
 *    "one in-flight refund per order line" true without a lock. So every
 *    statement that moves a refund to a terminal status flips `is_open` in the
 *    same transaction step — `settleRefund` does both, and nothing else may
 *    write `status` on its own.
 *  - **`orders.refunded_amount <= orders.paid_amount`** is a CHECK, so the
 *    cumulative ceiling is enforced by PostgreSQL even if a caller forgets to
 *    ask. The service still asks, under `FOR UPDATE`, so the shopper gets
 *    `REFUND_EXCEEDS_PAID` instead of a 500 (REFUND-007).

 *  - `whole-line` — goods that came back, a settlement, a release: the ceiling
 *    is the line's whole quantity, and lowering a count never crosses it.
 *  - `retry` — a request that is sent again: it may keep what it already
