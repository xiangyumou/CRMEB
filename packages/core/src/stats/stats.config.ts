/**
 * `stats` — the knobs the statistics screens have.
 *
 * The first two exist because a statistics page is the easiest place in an admin to ask
 * the database for something enormous by accident:
 *
 * - `exportMaxRows` caps a CSV export. The route answers with the file inside a
 *   JSON envelope, so the whole thing is built in memory before it is sent; a
 *   cap is not a nicety. Over the cap the export refuses with
 *   `STATS_EXPORT_TOO_LARGE` and asks for a narrower window rather than quietly
 *   handing back a truncated file that looks complete.
 * - `cacheSeconds` is how long a computed block is reused. 60 by default: long
 *   enough that a dashboard being watched during a sale does not re-run every
 *   aggregate on every poll, short enough that an operator refreshing after a
 *   fix sees the new number within a minute. `0` turns caching off, which is
 *   what a shop debugging a figure wants.
 *
 * `visitRetentionDays` is how long page views (`user_visits`) are kept; the
 * nightly `user.pruneVisits` job deletes what is older. 400 by default, so a
 * month can still be compared with the same month a year earlier. Past the
 * window 访客数 / 浏览量 read 0, which is why the floor is a quarter rather than
 * a week.
