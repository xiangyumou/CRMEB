/**
 * Statistics permission atoms.
 *
 * One `read` per screen, because the four screens answer to different people —
 * whoever watches traffic is rarely whoever watches revenue — and two
 * `export` atoms on top of the reads.
 *
 * **Export is its own atom, deliberately.** Reading 交易统计 on screen and
 * walking out with the whole window as a CSV are different acts: the file
 * leaves the building and the audit trail behind it is one row saying somebody
 * exported. With a single 统计 permission covering both, every operator who
 * could open the page could take the file.
 *
 * There is no `stats:*:write`: nothing in this domain writes anything.
