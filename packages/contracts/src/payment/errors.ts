/**
 * Payment error codes.
 *
 * One code per decision the caller can act on, not per internal branch. Two
 * groups matter:
 *
 *  - **409s are ordinary traffic.** A shopper double-tapping 支付 while a
 *    callback settles the order is not an incident; it is a race whose losing
 *    side gets `PAYMENT_ORDER_ALREADY_PAID` and a screen that says 已支付.
 *  - **`PAYMENT_STATE_UNKNOWN` is never a guess.** When the gateway did not
 *    answer, the only honest reply is "we do not know yet, nothing was
 *    released" (PAYC-002 / QUEUE-004). Turning an unknown into a `closed` is
 *    the defect this whole domain exists to prevent, so it has its own code and
 *    its own Chinese message telling the operator to check by hand.
