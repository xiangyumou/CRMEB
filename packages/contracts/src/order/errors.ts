 * they can do nothing different about which of five reasons made a coupon
 * unusable, which is why that one stays a single `COUPON_NOT_USABLE` in the
 * coupon domain.
 *
 * The three cancellation codes are the cancel-vs-pay decision table: when a
 * cancel races a payment, the gateway says `closed` (cancel proceeds), `paid`
 * (`ORDER_ALREADY_PAID`, and the order is marked paid first) or `unknown`
 * (`ORDER_PAYMENT_STATE_UNKNOWN`, and nothing at all is released).
