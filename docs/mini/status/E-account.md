# Stream E — account and content pages (status)

Worktree `CRMEB-mini-wt/E-account`, branch `storefront/mini-E-account` (from `storefront/mini`).
Updated at every commit so the work can resume after an interruption.

## Done

- Orientation: contracts, UI kit, session, platform seam, B's `DecorPage` (not merged yet).
- `catalog.myReviews` gains `status` (additive contract fix, for 我的评价's 待审核).
- `platform/invoice-title{,.h5}.ts` + `invoice-title-map.ts` (`chooseInvoiceTitle`, 模拟小程序
  answers the harness's `invoiceTitle`); the Taro fake gained `chooseInvoiceTitle`.
- `features/checkout/address-choice.ts` (the address picked in select mode).
- `packages/account/shared` (SubmitBar, error helpers, SMS, password rules), `src/test/account-fixture.ts`.
- 个人资料 (chooseAvatar + nickname input, C09 field error), 设置, 手机号 (bind WeChat / SMS,
  change by SMS), 修改密码 (old password or SMS; silent re-sign-in), 找回密码. Tests.
- 收货地址 (导入微信地址: saved in one tap when the region resolves against the city tree,
  else handed to the form; select mode writes `address-choice` and goes back; 默认, 编辑,
  删除) and 新增 / 编辑地址 (RegionPicker, import, 默认). S4's checkout (stream B's page) got a
  minimal hook: tapping the address opens select mode, the preview/create body sends
  `addressId`. Tests.

- 我的收藏 / 浏览记录 (管理 mode, batch 取消收藏 / 删除, 清空; history grouped by day) and 我的评价
  (stars, pictures, reply; 待审核 as a neutral 「审核后展示」). Tests.
- 消息中心 (a `data.route` opens that page and marks read; else 消息详情; 全部已读; 删除) and
  消息详情 (marks read once shown; 查看详情 when routed; 删除). Tests.

- 发票 (tabs 发票抬头 / 开票记录; 设为默认, 删除, cap of 20), 新增 / 编辑发票抬头 (从微信导入,
  企业 / 个人, 专票 fields, C09 name error), 发票详情 (撤回, 重新申请, 未通过的原因), 申请开票
  (default title first, 新增抬头 comes back picked, remark; `invoiceRequestFromTitle` copied
  locally). Tests.

- Merged storefront/mini (C + A2) at `71c60b452`: kept both sides of the Taro fake.
- 协议 (`pages/agreement`: key → title, operator HTML through the DIY 富文本 renderer
  `features/content/rich-content.tsx`, 「内容整理中」 when empty, WeChat's 隐私保护指引 on
  隐私政策) and 注销账号 (what it does, the 注销协议, reason, tick + danger confirm → request →
  logout → result; pending shows 审核中 + 撤回; a rejected one says why). The Taro fake gained
  `RichText` and `WebView`. Password rule gained the server's two-kinds check. Tests.

- content: 资讯 (全部 + top-level category tabs, a category includes its children via
  `categoryIds`; share 好友), 资讯详情 (rich text, linked product, 「相关链接」 lists the
  `<a href>`s that `rich-text` cannot tap plus 阅读原文, all through `openExternalLink`; share
  好友 + 朋友圈), 网页 (业务域名 → `<WebView>`; else a sheet 「该链接需在浏览器中打开」 with
  复制链接). Tests.

- 我的 tab (`decor.pageUserCenter` through `features/decor-lite/decor-page.tsx`, a minimal
  renderer with B's `{ page, route }` interface: links via `openLinkTarget`, `login` →
  `requireLogin(me)`, 客服 as WeChat's contact button / call / note; refetch on sign-in, on show,
  on pull-down; 「N 条未读消息」 row). **Swap to B's `features/decor/decor-page.tsx` and delete
  `features/decor-lite/` once B merges.** Tests.

- e2e `specs-mini/account.spec.ts` (7 tests): risky nickname → field error; address add / edit /
  pick at checkout / delete; 收藏 list (favourite arranged via API, the button is B's product
  page); a 支付成功 message opens its order; invoice title imported from WeChat; 我的评价 shows a
  held review; 注销 signs out (token dead on the server too). `EmulatedWechatUser` (app and e2e)
  now types `invoiceTitle`.
- `docs/mini/pages.md` form changes for the E pages.

## In progress

- Merging storefront/mini (B merged): swap `decor-lite` for B's `DecorPage`, reconcile the
  checkout address picking with B's checkout, rerun the address e2e (it drove the S4 stub).

## Next

6. Screenshots in `docs/mini/status/E-screens/` (retake after the merge); checklist; sizes.

## Backend gaps found

- `catalog.myReviews` returned no status, though the list includes 待审核 and hidden rows.
