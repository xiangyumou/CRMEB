# F2 — DIY v2 admin editor (店铺装修): status

Branch `storefront/mini-F2-decor-editor`. Updated at every commit so the work can resume after an
interruption.

## Done

- Contracts (reported to the user): `visibility.platforms` is no longer `hidden` — the editor draws
  an array of an enum as a multi-select (`meta.ts` convention 3 says so; radio threshold ≤ 4).
- Editor adapter `apps/web/src/admin/decor/`:
  - `zod-to-puck.ts`: switch / choice (Segmented or Select) / multiChoice / group headings
    (`__group:` pseudo fields) / every semantic kind; `initialPropsOf` (min list items).
  - `document.ts`: v2 document ⇄ Puck data; older blocks migrated in, unknown / newer / failed
    blocks carried through untouched as `__unknown`; `canonicalJson` for the dirty check.
  - `config.tsx`: built from the contracts registry (every block), palette filtered by
    `meta.pages` for the page kind, storefront component or a “画布暂无预览” placeholder,
    phone navbar with the page title.
  - `canvas-data.tsx`: `DecorCanvasData.resolve(need)`, `useCanvasSlots`; admin implementation
    previews products (as the resolver picks them); other needs show the block's empty state.
  - `records.tsx`: `DecorRecordSource` (products, labels, articles, coupons, group-buys via the
    legacy DIY source; presales and 微页面 new).
  - `fields/`: image (AssetPicker), colour (presets), choice, switch, multi-select, group heading,
    link (every kind; `route` covers every linkable catalogue key with param controls —
    `link-routes.ts`, held in step with the catalogue by `link-routes.test.ts`), the five data
    sources (manual ordered list / rule), unsupported fallback.
  - `editor.tsx`: `DecorEditor` (Chinese Puck dictionary, custom toolbar + undo/redo, read-only
    mode) and `DecorPagePreview` (read-only phone frame).
- ESLint: `@puckeditor/*` may only be imported inside `src/admin/decor`.
- `/admin/dev/decor-spike` kept as the **decor component sandbox** (dev-only; the fidelity script
  shoots its canvas), moved to the new interfaces.
- Unit tests: `zod-to-puck`, `document`, `canvas`, `fields/link-routes` (72 green).

- Admin pages (`店铺装修（新版）`, menu `decor.menu.ts`, all gated by `decor:page:*`):
  - `/admin/decor` (`page-list.tsx`): kind filter, 当前首页 / 当前个人中心 card (恢复内置个人中心),
    designation tags, 线上版本 / 有未发布修改, rename / duplicate / delete (not while designated),
    设为首页 / 设为个人中心 with a confirm (only published pages of the matching kind).
  - 新建页面 (`create-document.tsx`): kind, name, 从模板开始 (blank + `templates/`, thumbnails).
  - `/admin/decor/[id]` (`page-editor.tsx`, via `next/dynamic`): full-window editor; explicit
    保存草稿 with the draft token; `DECOR_VERSION_CONFLICT` → 载入对方的版本 / 用我的覆盖;
    发布 with a note (saves first); issues / warnings listed under the toolbar with 定位;
    unsaved guard (back button confirm + `beforeunload`); “草稿已在别处被修改” tag.
  - 发布记录 drawer (`revisions.tsx`): 查看 (read-only editor over the revision), 回滚 (confirm),
    then offer 载入到编辑器.
  - 预览 drawer (`preview.tsx`): preview token; iframe of `DECOR_PREVIEW_URL` (new optional env,
    `{id}` `{previewToken}` `{kind}`) or the 体验版 note + copyable `packages/page/index?…`.

- Page tests: `session.test.ts`, `page-editor.test.tsx`, `page-list.test.tsx` (95 green in
  `src/admin/decor`).
- e2e `e2e/admin/specs/decor.spec.ts` (3 tests, green): create → save (storefront 404) → publish →
  publish with unsaved edits → rollback (new revision, draft untouched) → read-only revision view;
  preview iframe through the token (the e2e stack sets `DECOR_PREVIEW_URL` to the storefront read);
  designate 首页 → `/api/v1/pages/home`. Cited under DECOR-008 / 011 / 012 / 014; README row.
  `coupon.spec.ts` failed twice in one full run (antd Select dropdown over 适用范围) and passes
  alone — not touched by F2; watch it in the final full run.

## In progress

- `docs/mini/decor.md` notes (editor pages, env, platforms).

## Next

- Templates last (after `git merge storefront/mini` if G1 has merged).
- Checks, screenshots (`docs/mini/status/F2-screens/`), report.
