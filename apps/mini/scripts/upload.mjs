/**
 * Uploads `dist/weapp` as a development version (公众平台 → 版本管理 → 开发版本, from which the
 * operator picks 体验版 or submits for review), through miniprogram-ci's CLI:
 *
 *   WX_MINI_UPLOAD_KEY_PATH=private.wx4f4b772125e155ed.key \
 *     node apps/mini/scripts/upload.mjs --confirm [--desc "…"] [--robot 1]
 *   node apps/mini/scripts/upload.mjs --dry-run        # every check, nothing uploaded
 *
 * **Every run without `--dry-run` uploads the package to WeChat's servers.** Run it only when the
 * user has approved this one upload; `--confirm` is never defaulted and never read from the
 * environment.
 *
 * The version is `package.json`'s (1.0.0); the operator manages versions in 公众平台, so this
 * script takes no version flag. It refuses to run unless:
 *
 * - the key, a real AppID, and a build that size-report passed on exactly as it is now — never a
 *   `dev:weapp` or bare `taro build` output, whose stylesheets and scripts nothing has checked
 *   (the same terms as `preview.mjs`, wx-ci.mjs);
 * - the build is exactly a commit: the working tree is clean and size-report stamped this build
 *   from HEAD on a clean tree;
 * - that commit is released the way deploy/ship.sh releases one: it is on origin/master and the
 *   `ci` workflow's push run for it concluded `success` (asked with `gh`).
 *
 * `--dry-run` runs every check and prints the miniprogram-ci command (key path elided) instead
 * of running it; it needs neither `--confirm` nor miniprogram-ci.
