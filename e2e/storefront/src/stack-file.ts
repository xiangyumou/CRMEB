/**
 * The handoff between `scripts/serve.ts` (which owns the containers, the web
 * server, the worker, the fake gateway and the edge) and the specs (which need
 * the same database and Redis to arrange what the storefront cannot create by
 * itself, and to read back what it cannot show).
 *
 * A file rather than an environment variable, for the reason `@shop/e2e-admin`
 * gives: Playwright spawns the `webServer` command as a child, so the parent
 * cannot read anything the child discovers, and the container ports are only
 * known once the containers are up.
 *
 * It lives in the system temp directory, never in the repository, so no run
 * leaves behind something `git status` would show or `prettier` would
 * reformat.
 *
 * ## One checkout, one stack
 *
 * The same rule as `@shop/e2e-admin`: several checkouts (worktrees) may run
 * this suite on one machine at once. With fixed ports, one fixed stack file
 * and `reuseExistingServer` on, the second run's Playwright would find the
 * first run's edge answering, reuse it, and drive its specs against the
 * *other* checkout's H5 bundle, build and database. So:
 *
 * - the default ports and stack file are derived from the checkout's path
 *   (`CHECKOUT_ID` below), so two checkouts never share them by default;
 * - reusing a server that is already up is opt-in, `SHOP_E2E_REUSE=1`
 *   (`playwright.config.ts`); without it a busy port is an error, not a
 *   silent handover;
 * - `SHOP_E2E_PORT`, `SHOP_E2E_WEB_PORT`, `SHOP_E2E_GATEWAY_PORT` and
 *   `SHOP_E2E_STOREFRONT_STACK` still override each, e.g. to run the same
 *   checkout twice.
 *
 * ## Which storefront
 *
 * `SHOP_E2E_CLIENT` picks the client the stack serves and the specs drive:
 *
 * - `uniapp` (the default): the uni-app H5 build, `specs/`;
 * - `mini`: the Taro mini-program's H5 build in "模拟小程序" mode
 *   (`apps/mini`, `build:h5:mp-emulation`), `specs-mini/`, with the fake
 *   `api.weixin.qq.com` for `wx.login` / `getPhoneNumber`
 *   (docs/mini/spikes/S4-e2e.md).
 *
 * The two get different default ports, stack files and databases, so both
 * can be up at once in one checkout.
