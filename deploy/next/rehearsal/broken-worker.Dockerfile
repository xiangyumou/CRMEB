# The fault is the one a container healthcheck is *supposed* to catch and the
# easiest one to get wrong: a process that starts, stays up, logs nothing
# alarming — and does no work. It writes no heartbeat, so `worker:heartbeat`
# never appears, the container healthcheck fails, and `compose up --wait` and
# the readiness gate both refuse the release.
#
# A candidate that crashed outright would be a weaker drill: Docker reports a
# restarting container without any healthcheck at all, so it would prove
# nothing about the probe.
