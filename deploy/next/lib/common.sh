#   - no secret ever reaches argv; passwords are read inside the container
#     from the container's own environment;
#   - `docker compose` is always called with the same project, file and env
#     file, so a rehearsal against a disposable copy is one variable away;
#   - an image reference recorded for rollback is immutable — a digest, or for
#     a locally built image the content id alongside the reference.
