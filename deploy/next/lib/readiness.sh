# The readiness gate. Sourced by upgrade.sh and rollback.sh; also runnable on
# its own through `deploy/next/readyz.sh`.
#
# `/healthz` at the edge is shallow by design: nginx answering for itself, so a
# slow app cannot take the edge's own liveness probe down with it. A *container*
# healthcheck must stay shallow too — a probe that opens a PostgreSQL connection
# restarts the container when the database blips (apps/web/src/server/health.ts
# says so in as many words).
#
# The deep check now has an HTTP surface: the edge proxies `/readyz` to the
# app's `/api/v1/readyz` (CR-1-j2), which answers database, Redis, schema and
# worker heartbeat, or 503 with `{code, message, details: {checks}}` and nothing
# else. Nothing restarts a container on that answer; a *release* is gated on it,
# here. Five things, in the order they fail usefully:
#
#   1. every service Compose started reports healthy;
#   2. the edge answers /healthz for itself;
#   3. the edge answers /readyz through to the app, with every check ok;
#   4. the schema is migrated — the migrations table is populated and the
#      tables the release needs exist;
#   5. the worker heartbeat is fresh.
#
# 3 overlaps 4 and 5, and they stay anyway. 4 is per release: the tables come
# from `NEXT_READINESS_TABLES` and the app cannot know which ones this release
# needs. 5 read through `compose exec` is the second vantage point OPS-002 asks
# for — the app reads the heartbeat over the same `REDIS_URL` the worker writes
# it with, so it would find the key even on the wrong Redis. And an endpoint
# that reports itself ready is worth checking against the database directly at
# the moment of a release.
#
# 3 is also the only one of the five that works before the stack is reachable
# by any other means, and the only one an uptime monitor or a load balancer can
# run — which is the whole reason CR-1-j2 exists.

# Tables every release needs before it can serve. Deliberately a small,
# hand-picked list rather than "count the tables": a count passes on a schema
# that migrated halfway.
