#
# In order, refusing to continue when a step cannot be proven:
#
#   1. all three candidates are fixed digests (a moving tag is refused), and
#      the running images are recorded as the rollback target;
#   2. the candidates are pulled *before* anything is stopped, so a registry
#      problem is not discovered mid-window;
#   3. the candidate worker image is asked, read-only, whether the database
#      has migrations it has not applied (`db/src/pending.mjs`);
#   4. then one of two paths:
#
#      - **migrations pending** (or the question could not be answered, or
#        this is the first deploy): `web`, `worker` and `edge` are stopped — a
#        migration never runs against live writers — a dump is taken and
#        proved restorable, the migrations and the reference seed run as the
#        `migrate` one-shot, and the stack starts on the candidates;
#      - **nothing to migrate**: nothing is stopped. The dump is still taken
#        and proved (`pg_dump` reads one consistent snapshot, and that dump is
#        the way back), the reference seed runs beside the live stack, and
#        `up -d` recreates only the services whose image or configuration
#        changed. A release that changes only the Compose files — a label, a
#        redirect — goes through here too, and changes only what they change;
#
#   5. the stack has to pass the readiness gate;
#   6. **any failure after the candidates are pinned rolls the images back to
#      what was running**, and the script says whether the schema had moved.
#
# Why the seed may run beside live writers: every statement in it is an upsert
# on a natural key, inside one transaction, and it touches only reference
# tables (cities, express companies, agreement and notification shells). It
# never deletes or truncates. Readers do not wait on it; a write to one of the
# same rows waits for its commit, a few seconds at most.
#
# Why an automatic rollback rather than stopping in maintenance mode: the
# migrations are additive (CI refuses one that is not), so the previous image
# tolerates the new schema, and an unattended failure is better ending on a
# stack that serves than on a stack that is down. When the migration had
# already run, the script says so in as many words and names the dump, because
# *data* recovery is a separate, deliberate operation and this script never
# performs one.
#
# `--skip-migration` runs neither the migrations nor the seed, and so stops
# nothing. `--dry-run` goes as far as step 3, reports the path the release
# would take, and changes nothing.
#
# Exit codes: 0 deployed · 1 failed, rolled back to the previous images ·
#             2 misuse · 3 failed AND the rollback failed — needs a human.
