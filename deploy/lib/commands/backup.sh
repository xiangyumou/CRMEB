#
# "The dump exists" and "the dump is usable" are different claims, and only the
# second one is worth a release waiting for. So the default path restores the
# dump into a throwaway PostgreSQL with **no network at all** and compares the
# row count of every table in `public`:
#
#   - against the rows the dump itself carries, always: every row it holds
#     must come back;
#   - against the live database, when nothing is writing to it (`web` and
#     `worker` stopped, as during a release that migrates): the dump must hold
#     every row there is.
#
# While the writers run, the live counts move under the comparison, so the
# second check becomes "the dump has every table the live database has".
# `pg_dump` reads one consistent snapshot either way, which is what makes a
# dump taken beside live traffic a valid rollback point.
#
# `--no-verify` exists for a scheduled dump on a host with no spare memory; a
# release never uses it. `--verify-only` runs the proof against a dump that
# already exists and takes none — for checking last night's backup, or the one
# a recovery is about to depend on. It compares against the live database, so
# run it while nothing is writing, or expect the counts to disagree.
#
# Exit codes: 0 verified · 1 the dump failed or does not verify · 2 misuse.
