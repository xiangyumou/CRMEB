#
# The migration is appended to the image's own journal, one second after the
# newest entry, which is exactly how drizzle sees a release that adds one: the
# read-only check (`db/src/pending.mjs`) reports it, and `shop upgrade` has to
# take the path that stops the writers.
#
# The drill builds it twice: with a harmless `CREATE TABLE`, and with a
# statement that fails, which is what a real migration failure looks like — a
# failed DDL and exit 1, not a crash. The worker itself is untouched in both,
# so each isolates one question.
