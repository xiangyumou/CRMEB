# The drill needs two *different* releases to prove anything about rolling
# back: an "upgrade" from a digest to itself makes "it ended on the previous
# digest" true no matter what the script did. A label is the smallest change
# that produces a new digest without changing a single byte of behaviour, so a
# rollback that lands on the wrong one is a rollback that is genuinely wrong
# rather than one that merely looks different.
