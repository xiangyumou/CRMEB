/**
 * A domain registers itself at import time, and `domains.gen.ts` is the one
 * place that imports every domain. This check keeps that true when a bundler
 * disagrees.
 *
 * esbuild removes a namespace import whose binding is never read
 * (`import * as diy from './diy/index'`), so under tsx and in the worker's tsup
 * bundle such a domain would silently not be installed — while Vitest (oxc) and
 * Next (SWC) keep it, so every test passes and the bundle is still wrong. The
 * generator therefore emits a bare side-effect import for every domain, and the
 * guards import each domain by name as well (`lib/install-domains.ts`), so they
 * never run on a half-installed system.
 *
 * Two assertions: the guards' own list covers exactly the declared domains, and
 * no domain in `domains.gen.ts` is reached only through an unused namespace
 * import.
