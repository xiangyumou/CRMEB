/**
 * Two properties every route file must have, and one it must have when it
 * writes.
 *
 * `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` — an API route that Next decides to prerender
 * answers from a build-time snapshot, which for `/admin-api/*` means serving
 * one admin's data to another.
 *
 * `ctx.audit(target)` — `handle()` writes the audit row for every mutating
 * admin request by itself, but the *target* (which coupon, which order) can
 * only come from the handler. An audit row that records "PUT /admin-api/…/:id"
 * with a null target is a log entry nobody can answer a question with.
 *
 * The exemptions are named one by one with the reason, exactly-compared: an
 * entry whose URL stops being an admin write, or whose route file starts naming
 * a target, fails until it is deleted, so the list cannot quietly become a
 * baseline.
