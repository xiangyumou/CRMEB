/**
 * The guard harness.
 *
 * A guard is a pure function over the repository's own text: contracts, route
 * files, permission atoms, config descriptors, the uni-app sources, the
 * migrations, the CI workflow and the rule catalogue. It never starts a server
 * and never opens a database, so `pnpm guards` is a second or two and can run
 * on every commit.
 *
 * Two verdicts:
 *
 *   `fail`  something is wrong now — the guard exits non-zero.
 *   `note`  context worth printing. Never fatal.
 *
 * There is deliberately no "known, fix later" level. A property that is
 * allowed to be false somewhere is an allow-list entry inside the check, with
 * the reason next to it, and every such list is compared exactly: an entry
 * that stops applying is itself a failure, so a list can only shrink.
