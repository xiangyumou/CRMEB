# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# The `web` image: the Next.js standalone server that serves `/admin`,
# `/admin-api/*` and `/api/v1/*`.
#
#   docker build -f docker/web.Dockerfile -t crmeb-next-web ./next
#
# The build context is the repository root (the pnpm workspace root), filtered by the
# adjacent `web.Dockerfile.dockerignore`. A per-Dockerfile ignore file is used
# rather than a root `.dockerignore` so each image states its own context filter
# next to its Dockerfile.
#
# Why the whole workspace is copied before `pnpm install`, rather than the usual
# manifests-only layer: a hardcoded list of `COPY packages/<name>/package.json`
# lines has to be edited every time a package is added, and a forgotten line
# fails only inside the image build. The pnpm store cache mount
# gives back most of what the finer-grained layer would have saved.
