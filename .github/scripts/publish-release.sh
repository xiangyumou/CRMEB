# The images job in `ci.yml` calls it once per role.
#
# The rules live here, not inline in the workflow, so they can be exercised
# against a real registry (`publish-release.test.sh`, next to this file)
# instead of being trusted by reading YAML:
#
#   * an existing tag whose digest differs aborts BEFORE the tag is written;
#   * an authentication or network error while asking whether a tag exists is
#     never read as "the tag is absent";
#   * republishing the same candidate reproduces the same digest and is a no-op.
#
# It never moves a deployment tag: a release is deployed by digest, and a
# commit-scoped tag, once written, never changes.
