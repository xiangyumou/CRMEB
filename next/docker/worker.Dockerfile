# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# The `worker` image: the BullMQ worker, and — under a different command — the
# `migrate` one-shot.
#
#   docker build -f next/docker/worker.Dockerfile -t crmeb-next-worker ./next
#
#   worker:   node /app/main.mjs                (the default CMD)
#   migrate:  node /app/db/src/migrate.mjs && node /app/db/src/seed/index.mjs
#
# `.mjs`, not `.js`: the bundle is ESM and `/app` has no `package.json` of its
# own, so the extension is what tells node how to read it.
#
# ## `pnpm deploy --prod` or an esbuild bundle? Both, for different halves.
#
# `pnpm deploy --prod` alone does not produce a runnable image here. The
# `@shop/*` packages publish **TypeScript source** — `packages/db/package.json`
# exports `./src/index.ts` — so a pruned `node_modules` leaves node importing
# files it cannot parse. Making it work would mean either adding a TS loader to
# production (a devDependency in the runtime path, and a startup cost on every
# boot) or asking four packages to emit build output they otherwise do not need.
#
# An esbuild bundle alone does not work either. `bullmq` reads its Lua scripts
# from disk at runtime, `pg` and `ioredis` load optional native bindings: all
# three break when inlined, which is why `apps/worker/tsup.config.ts` lists them
# as external.
#
# So: **tsup (esbuild) bundles everything we wrote**, `@shop/*` included, and
# **`pnpm deploy --prod` materialises only the handful of packages the bundle
# deliberately left external**. The result is ~200 MB against ~1.4 GB for a
# whole-workspace image, which matters on a 2-core / 3.6 GB host that holds
# the running release and the next one side by side.
