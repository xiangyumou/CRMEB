/**
 * The handoff between `scripts/serve.ts` (which owns the containers) and the
 * specs (which need the same database to arrange fixtures and to read back
 * audit rows).
 *
 * A file rather than an environment variable, because Playwright spawns the
 * `webServer` command as a child: the parent cannot read anything the child
 * later discovers, and the ports are only known once the containers are up.
 *
 * It lives in the system temp directory, not in the repository, so no run can
 * leave something behind that `git status` would show or `prettier` would
 * reformat.
 *
 * ## One checkout, one stack
 *
 * Several checkouts of this repository (worktrees) run the suite on the same
 * machine at the same time. With one fixed port and one fixed stack file they
 * used to find each other: the second run's Playwright saw a server already
 * answering on the port, reused it, and ran its specs against the *first*
 * checkout's build and database — green or red for reasons that had nothing
 * to do with its own code. So:
 *
 * - the default port and stack file are derived from the checkout's path
 *   (`CHECKOUT_ID` below), so two checkouts never share either by default;
 * - reusing a server that is already up is opt-in, `SHOP_E2E_REUSE=1`
 *   (`playwright.config.ts`); without it a busy port is an error, not a
 *   silent handover;
 * - `SHOP_E2E_PORT` and `SHOP_E2E_STACK` still override both, e.g. to run
 *   the same checkout twice.
