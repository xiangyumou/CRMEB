/**
 * Admin end-to-end suite.
 *
 * One command, from `next/`:
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @shop/e2e-admin e2e
 *
 * Playwright's `webServer` is `scripts/serve.ts` — a script that runs
 * `pnpm gen`, brings up PostgreSQL 17 and Redis 7 (Testcontainers, or an
 * already-running pair through `SHOP_TEST_PG_URL` / `SHOP_TEST_REDIS_URL`),
 * applies the schema, seeds the fixtures, builds the app if it has not been
 * built, and starts the real Next server against them.
 *
 * Why the stack is inside the `webServer` command rather than in `globalSetup`:
 * Playwright starts `webServer` *before* `globalSetup` runs, so a globalSetup
 * that created the database would create it after the server had already
 * failed to connect. Putting both in one script also means `SIGINT` kills the
 * containers and the server together.
 *
 * `workers: 1` is deliberate. Every worker would share the one database and the
 * one Redis, so parallel specs would see each other's orders, coupons and
 * audit rows. The suite is an authorisation and money check, not a load test;
 * `next/load` is the one that is allowed to be parallel.
