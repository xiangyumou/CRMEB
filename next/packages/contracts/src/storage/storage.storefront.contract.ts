/**
 * Uploads that do not come from the admin console.
 *
 * Two of them, and they are deliberately different:
 *
 * - `/api/v1/uploads` is the shopper's: avatar, review pictures, refund
 *   evidence. It needs a storefront session, is rate-limited per user, accepts
 *   images only, and answers with a renderable URL rather than a library row.
 * - `/api/v1/attachments/scan-uploads/:token` is the phone that scanned an
 *   admin's QR code. It is `public` because the phone has no admin cookie — the
 *   single-use token *is* the credential, and it carries the admin's identity,
 *   so the attachment lands in the right library owned by the right person.
 */

/**
 * `multipart/form-data` with **exactly one** part named `file` (CR-5-h §1).
 *
 * The field name is part of the contract, not a convention: an upload has no
 * JSON body for `handle()` to validate, so nothing else can catch the client
 * that sends `image` (legacy's name) or `multipart` (the old uni-app pages').
 * A file under any other name is `STORAGE_UPLOAD_FIELD_MISSING`, which names
 * the fix, rather than `STORAGE_NO_FILE`, which told the shopper to pick a
 * photo they had already picked.
 *
 * Further file parts in the same request are **ignored**, not refused: the one
 * named `file` is the upload, and a form that also carries, say, a thumbnail
 * the server does not want should not fail outright.
 *
 * `purpose=staff` is refused unless the caller is on the 店员 list, and carries
 * its own size ceiling — see `userUploadPurpose` (CR-5-h §2).
