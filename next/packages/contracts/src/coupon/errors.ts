 * Coupon error codes.

 * message says what to do next rather than what the server failed at. The
 * generic 404/422/429 cases come from `commonErrors` and are not repeated here.
 *
 * A refusal that comes from losing a race (sold out, per-user limit, already
 * redeemed) is a 409, not a 500: two people tapping "领取" at the same instant
 * is ordinary traffic, not an incident.
