/**
 * Notification error codes.
 *
 * There are few of them, and that is the design. Sending is never a
 * request/response operation — it happens behind the effects ledger after the
 * business transaction committed — so almost nothing a caller does can be
 * refused. What is left is the admin's template screen and the two inbox
 * surfaces, where a refusal really is a decision the caller can act on.
 *
 * Notice what is *not* here: no `NOTIFICATION_SEND_FAILED`. A failed send never
 * reaches an HTTP response, because a failed send must never fail an order, a
 * payment or a refund. It lands in the ledger, is retried with backoff, and
 * ends up in 通知发送记录 for a human.
