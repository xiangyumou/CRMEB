/**
 * What the buyer does with a shipped order: look at the parcels and confirm
 * receipt.
 *
 * Three routes where legacy had `order/take`, `order/express/:uni/[:type]` and
 * a detail endpoint that embedded a differently shaped express blob. The
 * shipments are their own sub-resource because an order can have several of
 * them now that partial shipment is a first-class thing.
 *
 * `POST …/receipt` is the same `OrderStateMachine.transition(shipped ->
 * received)` the auto-receive job runs, so the buyer tapping 确认收货 at the
 * exact moment the job fires is one transition and one set of effects, decided
 * by the affected row count.
