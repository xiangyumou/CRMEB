/**
 * The administrative-division tree — read-only, on both surfaces.
 *
 * The legacy system had seven city routes: a full list, a children list, add,
 * edit, save, delete and `city/clean_cache`. None of them survive as writes.
 * `cities` is **seed data** (3939 rows, `packages/db/seed-data/cities.json`)
 * that the whole shop's freight rules and address snapshots key on; letting an
 * operator rename or delete a division at runtime is how a freight region
 * quietly stops matching, and the legacy cache-bust route existed precisely
 * because nothing invalidated the cached tree when they did.
 *
 * So: the tree is immutable, the response carries a `version` fingerprint, and
 * there is no cache to bust. Recorded in `docs/rewrite/invariants.md`.
