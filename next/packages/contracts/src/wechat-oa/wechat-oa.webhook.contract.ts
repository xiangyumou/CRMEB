/**
 * The Official Account message callback, `/api/v1/webhooks/wechat-oa`.
 *
 * ## These two routes do not go through `handle()`
 *
 * Everything else in the system speaks JSON. WeChat does not: the verification
 * handshake wants the bare `echostr` back as `text/plain`, and an event wants
 * either the five ASCII letters `success` or an XML reply document. `handle()`
 * always serialises to JSON, so the two route files build their `Response`
 * themselves and keep to one line of logic each — the parsing, the signature
 * check and the reply engine all live in `core/src/wechat-oa`.
 *
 * They are declared here anyway, because the OpenAPI document is what tells an
 * operator which URL to paste into 公众平台 → 服务器配置, and because the
 * storefront adapter must be able to see that this path is taken. `response` is
 * `z.string()`: the literal body bytes.
 *
 * ## The order of operations, which is the whole security story
 *
 *  1. **Signature first, before any parsing.** `sha1(sort(token, timestamp,
 *     nonce))` compared with `timestamp_signature`-style constant time. A body
 *     that fails this is never XML-parsed, never logged in full and never
 *     touches the database — so a forged "user 张三 unsubscribed" cannot even
 *     cost us a row. Answered `403` with the body `invalid signature`.
 *  2. **Decrypt if the account is in 安全模式/兼容模式.** AES-256-CBC with the
 *     43-character `EncodingAESKey`, and the appid inside the envelope is
 *     checked against ours — decrypting successfully is not the same as the
 *     message being for us.
 *  3. **Deduplicate.** WeChat re-delivers anything it did not get `success`
 *     for within five seconds, up to three times. `MsgId` for a message,
 *     `FromUserName + CreateTime + Event` for an event (events carry no
 *     `MsgId`), held in Redis for 15 minutes and also as an effects-ledger key
 *     for the durable parts. A replay is answered `success` and does nothing.
 *  4. **Answer inside five seconds.** Anything slow — resolving a scan to a
 *     user, sending a welcome template message — is recorded as an effect and
 *     done after the response. The synchronous part is one transaction.
 *
 * A body we cannot make sense of is still answered `success`: WeChat's only
 * alternative reading of a non-`success` body is "retry", and retrying a
 * message we will never understand three times is worse than dropping it.

/**
 * The handshake WeChat performs when the URL is saved in 公众平台.
 *
 * Note that it is a `GET` with the same signature triple as the `POST`, and
 * that the correct answer is the `echostr` **and nothing else** — no newline,
 * no quotes, no JSON. A server that answers `{"echostr":"..."}` fails the
 * handshake with a message that says only 配置失败.

 * `wechat-oa.webhook.service.ts`.
 *
 * The response is either `success` (nothing to say) or an XML reply document
 * produced by the auto-reply engine. Both are `text/xml; charset=utf-8` —
 * WeChat accepts `success` under that content type, and using one code path for
 * both removes the branch that gets the header wrong.
