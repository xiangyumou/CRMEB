/**
 * `runConcurrently` — the tool CONVENTIONS demands for every conditional state
 * change: "Every conditional state change ships a concurrency test using
 * `runConcurrently` from `@shop/testing`."
 *
 * The point is the *barrier*. Starting N promises in a loop does not make them
 * race: the first one is usually several event-loop turns ahead by the time the
 * last is created, so a read-then-write bug happily passes. Here every worker
 * blocks on one shared promise and they are all released in the same tick, so
 * they genuinely collide on the row.
