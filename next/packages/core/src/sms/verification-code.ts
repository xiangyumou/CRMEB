 * of them exploitable:
 *
 *  1. `register` and `reset` never deleted the key, so one code worked for its
 *     whole TTL — a code overheard once was a login for the next minute;
 *  2. there was no attempt counter, so six digits could be walked through at
 *     whatever rate the network allowed;
 *  3. one key served every purpose, so a code sent to confirm a phone change
 *     also logged you in.
 *
 * Here the scene is part of the key, the compare-and-delete is one Lua script
 * (the `GETDEL` the brief asks for, with a counter), and a wrong guess is
 * counted inside the same atomic step. Two concurrent verifications of the
 * same correct code therefore produce exactly one `ok`.
