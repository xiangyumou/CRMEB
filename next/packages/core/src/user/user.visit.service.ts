/**

 * The only thing that fills `user_visits`; without it 访客数 reads 0. One
 * insert feeds every figure that reads the table, with no change in `stats`,
 * and the page's later hide report adds its time on screen to that same row.
 *
 * **Nothing here can throw.** A beacon is fired while the visitor is doing
 * something else; a refusal it could see would either be swallowed (making the
 * check pointless) or retried (making the flood worse). So the throttle drops
 * the row and returns, and the route answers 204 either way. The one thing the
 * caller *can* get wrong — a path with a query string in it — is caught by the
 * contract before this runs, because that one is a privacy bug rather than a
 * volume one.

 * minute. A minute is long enough to collapse that and short enough that a
