/**
 * `system` atoms.
 *
 * One per job somebody actually does, not one per route. `admin:write` covers
 * creating, editing, enabling, disabling and resetting a password, because they
 * are the same job — managing an account; `admin:delete` is separate because
 * deleting one is irreversible and a different person usually signs off on it.
 *
 * `config:read` gates every settings page there is. A group may narrow that by
 * declaring its own `permission`, which is how the payment credentials screen
 * can be visible to fewer people than the site name.
