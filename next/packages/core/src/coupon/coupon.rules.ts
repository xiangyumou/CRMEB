/**
 * The coupon rules that are pure arithmetic: which cart lines a coupon covers,
 * what it takes off, and when it is valid.
 *
 * Everything here is a function of its arguments — no `ctx`, no database, no
 * clock — which is why it is in its own file and has a plain unit test
 * (`coupon.rules.test.ts`, no Docker). The service does the I/O and calls
 * these; the integration tests then only have to prove the I/O.
 *
 * Behaviour comes from `crmeb/app/services/order/OrderCouponCalculator.php`,
 * read and then rewritten rather than ported. Two rules from there that are
 * easy to get wrong and are kept exactly:
 *
 *  - `min_spend` is compared against the **eligible** subtotal, not the whole
 *    cart (`OrderCouponCalculator.php:51`). A 品类券 on a ¥200 cart with ¥30 of
 *    eligible goods does not meet a ¥100 threshold.
 *  - the discount is **capped at the eligible subtotal**
 *    (`:52`, `coupon_price > price ? price : coupon_price`), so a ¥50 coupon on
 *    ¥30 of eligible goods takes off ¥30, never ¥50.
