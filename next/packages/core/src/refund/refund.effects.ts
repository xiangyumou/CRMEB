/**
 * Refund's post-commit side effect.
 *
 * Exactly one, and it is the one that moves money: approving a `refund_only`, or
 * confirming that returned goods arrived, records `refund.execute` in the same
 * transaction as the decision. The gateway call then happens after that
 * transaction commits — the only ordering that cannot lose money, because an
 * in-transaction call would either refund something we then rolled back, or roll
 * back a refund WeChat already made.
 *
 * Delivery is at-least-once, so the handler has to be idempotent. It is: the
 * claim inside `executeRefund` only moves a row out of a state that allows
 * execution, and `out_refund_no` is frozen on the row, so a re-send is the same
 * refund as far as WeChat is concerned.
 *
 * The handler deliberately does **not** throw on a refusal or on an unknown
 * answer. Retrying a NOTENOUGH eight times helps nobody, and an `unknown` row is
 * the reconciliation sweep's job, not the ledger's — both leave a row an
 * operator can see and act on, which is what the 待处理 console is for.

 *
 * So it is delivered to a logged no-op rather than left without a handler: an
 * unhandled effect retries eight times and parks as `unknown`, one row per
 * refund in 待处理任务 that no operator action clears. The row stays as the
 * ledger's record of the settlement; a real consumer replaces this
 * registration. (It is keyed per order, so it records the order's first settled
 * refund; the `refunds` row and its log are the record of each one.)
