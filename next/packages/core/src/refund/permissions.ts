/**
 * Refund permission atoms.
 *
 * `review` and `execute` are separate because they are different decisions:
 * approving a request says "yes, this customer is owed money", while executing
 * one sends it. In a shop where customer service approves and finance pays,
 * that boundary is the control; in a small shop one role holds both, which is a
 * grant, not a code change.
 *
 * `config:read` / `config:write` gate the 售后设置 group (CR-10-k). The group
 * used to declare `request:write` — the remark atom — and the config service
 * derives a distinct write atom only from a `:read` one, so "add a remark"
 * also meant "change the address buyers post their returns to". Redirecting
 * goods is not a reviewer's decision; `config:write` belongs to whoever runs
 * after-sales, and holding it grants nothing on the requests themselves.
