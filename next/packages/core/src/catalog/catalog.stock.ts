/**
 * The catalog's implementation of `StockPort`.
 *
 * Stock leaves the shelf when the order is *placed*, not when it is paid. That
 * is the whole of risk-matrix §1's second row: the last unit must be
 * unsellable the instant somebody commits to buying it, and the only way to
 * make that true under concurrency is one statement whose WHERE clause carries
 * the precondition —
 *
 *     UPDATE product_skus SET stock = stock - $n WHERE id = $1 AND stock >= $n
 *
 * Two shoppers both run it; PostgreSQL serialises them on the row; the loser
 * changes no rows and is told 库存不足. Legacy read the row, compared in PHP and
 * then wrote (`StoreProductAttrValueServices::decProductAttrStock`), which is
 * the defect the brief names under "Fix, don't port".
 *
 * `sales` is a separate column moved only by `commit`, because a placed order
 * is not a sale. `release` therefore takes `{ committed }` to say whether it
 * has to come back down again (CR-1-a).
 *
 * Nothing here touches the product-level denormalised counters directly; each
 * method rolls the affected products up afterwards in the same transaction, so
 * `products.stock` can never disagree with the sum of its SKUs for longer than
 * one statement.
