 * the system needs from here is one question — "which openid is this user, on
 * this app" — which the payment domain has to answer before it can create a
 * JSAPI transaction.
 *
 * It lives in the `wechat` domain rather than in `payment` for the usual
 * reason: only a `*.repo.ts` may touch `@shop/db/schema/*`, and the table is
 * WeChat's, not payment's.
