 * the error go away — after which every payment on that shop was one DNS answer
 * away from being read and rewritten.
 *
 * There is no successor. Verification is the global `fetch`'s, the trust store
 * is the container's, and neither is reachable from an admin form. This test is
 * the guard that keeps it that way: a future field called `verifySsl` or
