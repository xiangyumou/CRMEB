/**
 * Payment's post-commit side effects.
 *
 * Exactly one, and it is the one that moves money: when a verified payment
 * cannot be booked against an order, the callback transaction records a
 * `payment_exceptions` row *and* this effect, in the same transaction. The
 * refund then happens after that transaction has committed, which is the only
 * ordering that cannot lose money — an in-transaction gateway call would either
 * refund something we then rolled back, or roll back a refund the gateway
 * already made.
 *
 * Delivery is at-least-once, so the handler has to be idempotent. It is,
 * twice over: `claimExceptionForRefund` freezes the refund number on the row
 * and only moves `open|refund_failed → refunding`, and WeChat itself treats a
 * repeated `out_refund_no` with the same amount as the same refund.
 *
 * A row an operator has already handled (`refunded`, `ignored`) makes the
 * handler a no-op rather than an error: the human beat the machine to it, which
 * is a success, not a failure to retry.
 *
 * The second registration, `('order', 'order.paid')`, is the hand-off row every
 * booked payment records (see `logOrderPaid`).

/**

 * the campaign seats, auto-delivery, the 站内信) runs on `onOrderPaid` hooks.
 *
 * So the row is delivered to a logged no-op rather than left without a handler
 * (CR-2-k2): an unhandled effect retries eight times and parks as `unknown`,
 * which would give an operator one row per paid order in 待处理任务 that no
 * action clears. The row itself stays, as the ledger's record that the payment
 * was booked; a real consumer replaces this registration.
