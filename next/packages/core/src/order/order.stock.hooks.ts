/**
 * The money arrived, so the reservation becomes a sale (CR-1-k2).
 *
 * `StockPort.commit` is the only thing that moves `product_skus.sales` (and,
 * through its roll-up, `products.sales`) up. Checkout reserved the stock, the
 * cancel path hands it back uncommitted, and the refund path hands it back with
 * `committed: true` — which only balances if this ran at payment. Before this
 * hook nothing called `commit`, so 已售 stayed at the migrated figure forever
 * and a refund lowered a number the payment had never raised.
 *
 * It runs for **every** paid order, whatever its kind. Group buy and presale
 * keep their own campaign ledgers (`groupbuy:take-seat`, `presale:commit-sale`)
 * and never touch the SKU's `sales`, so there is exactly one writer of the
 * SKU-level sale and no kind can count it twice. When a campaign then refuses
 * the sale (a lost seat, a filled quota), the order stays paid and its
 * auto-refund puts the units back through the refund path's committed release,
 * which is the mirror of this.
 *
 * Idempotent by the port's own ledger key (`catalog.stock.commit`, per order):
 * a second dispatch for the same order is a no-op, so a replayed notification
 * that somehow reached the hooks could not add the units twice.
 *
 * The lines are read from the order, not from the event, because they are what
 * checkout reserved: the same `stockLinesOf` the cancel path releases.
