/**
 * Resolving the `:id` of a storefront order route (CR-1-h).
 *
 * Every storefront route that names an order takes **either** the surrogate id
 * **or** the 24-digit order number, and every one of them resolves it here so
 * there is exactly one place that knows the rule and exactly one place that
 * decides who may see the order.
 *
 * ## Why the two can never collide
 *
 * `generateOrderNo` emits exactly `ORDER_NO_LENGTH` (24) digits. `orders.id` is
 * a `bigint` identity column, so the largest id that can ever exist has 19
 * digits, and `fromId` refuses anything past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (16
 * digits) besides. A reference of exactly 24 digits is therefore an order
 * number and a shorter one is an id, with no overlap to disambiguate and no
 * "try one, then the other" fallback that could be timed.
 *
 * ## Why the owner is in the WHERE
 *
 * A stranger's order number and an order number that was never issued give the
 * same answer: `null`, which every caller turns into its own 404. Resolving
 * first and authorising afterwards would leak the existence of other people's
 * orders to anyone who can guess a timestamp (AUTH-005).
