/**
 * Pricing, as pure functions.
 *
 * Nothing here reads a database, a clock or a port. The checkout service
 * gathers the facts — variants, contributors, the coupon quote, a freight
 * quote — and this file turns them into numbers, which is why the whole
 * pipeline is covered by a plain unit test with no container.
 *
 * Two properties are the point, and both are asserted in `order.pricing.test.ts`:
 *
 *  1. **Discount shares sum back exactly.** Every adjustment is split across
 *     the lines with `Money.allocate` (largest remainder), so
 *     `sum(order_items.discount_amount) === orders.coupon_discount` to the fen.
 *     A later partial refund therefore never has to re-prorate, which is where
 *     the legacy `RefundOrder` arithmetic went wrong.
 *  2. **No line is ever discounted below zero.** Adjustments are applied in
 *     `priority` order against what is *left* of each line, and anything that
 *     would overshoot is moved to a line that still has room.
 *
 * `orders.coupon_discount` is the column all of this lands in. It holds every
 * goods-level discount — the coupon and each `PricingContributor` — not just
 * the coupon; see CR-3-b1 and `docs/rewrite/status/b1.md`.
