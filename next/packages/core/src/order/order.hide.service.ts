/**
 * 删除订单, which deletes nothing.
 *
 * It is a flag because the order the buyer swipes away is still the shop's
 * record of a sale. The invoice may not be issued yet, the after-sales window
 * may still be open, and the accountant reconciles against rows nobody may
 * drop. So the button sets `orders.hidden_by_user_at`, the buyer's list stops
 * showing it, and every staff and admin query keeps seeing it — the asymmetry
 * is the feature.
 *
 * Two rules and both are in the WHERE, never in a prior read:
 *
 *  * **only a finished order.** `completed`, `cancelled`, `refunded`. Anything
 *    else is in flight, and a buyer who hides an unshipped order has hidden the
 *    screen they need when it arrives;
 *  * **only once.** `hidden_by_user_at IS NULL` is part of the guard, so two
 *    taps have exactly one winner and a refund landing between a read and this
 *    write cannot leave an in-flight order hidden.
 *
 * The loser cannot tell which rule it lost to, and that is deliberate rather
 * than lazy: after the first tap the order is no longer in this buyer's list,
 * so `ORDER_NOT_FOUND` is the honest description of what they are now pointing
 * at. `ORDER_NOT_DELETABLE` is reserved for the case where the order is still
 * visible and still unfinished — the only one a retry could fix.
