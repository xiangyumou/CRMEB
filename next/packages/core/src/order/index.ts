/**
 * The order domain's public surface.
 *
 * CONVENTIONS: "A domain in `core` may import another domain only through that
 * domain's `index.ts`". So this file is the contract between the order
 * aggregate and everybody else, and `order.repo.ts` in particular is private.
 *
 * | Export                | Caller | When                                       |
 * | --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
 * | `preview` / `create`  | routes | 确认订单 / 提交订单                         |
 * | `cancel`              | routes | 取消订单                                    |
 * | `cancelOrder`         | C, B2  | payment failed, admin close-out             |
 * | `autoCancel` / `sweepExpiredOrders` | jobs | the payment window closed     |
 * | `list` / `counts` / `detail` | routes | 我的订单                             |
 * | `hide`                | routes | 删除订单 (visibility only, CR-4-h §6)       |
 * | `rebuyLines`          | cart   | 再次购买                                    |
 * | `resolveCatalogPort`  | cart   | live price, stock and status of a variant   |
 *
 * **Direction of dependency.** The cart imports the order domain; the order
 * domain never imports the cart. That is why the catalogue seam
 * (`catalog.port.ts`, the read interface the catalog implements) is
 * re-exported from here, and why the two `cart_items` statements checkout
 * needs live in `order.repo.ts`. Recorded in `docs/rewrite/status/b1.md`.
 */

/**
 * Everything the order domain registers, in one idempotent call (the shape
 * `@shop/core/domains` looks for): the state machine streams C, B2 and D reach
 * through `getOrderStateMachine()`; the `OrderFactsPort` the catalog asks
 * about purchases and reviewable lines; the staff check `auth: 'staff'` fails
 * closed without; and the order-paid hook plus the notification handlers that
 * have to be installed before the first payment lands. Importing the domain
 * calls it once; a test that `resetOrderPorts()` calls it again.
