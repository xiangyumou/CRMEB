 * campaign; what is left over is how the window sweep behaves, and that is a
 * property of the shop.
 *
 * The group declares the *read* atom, as every config group does; the settings
 * service derives the write gate from it (`writePermissionFor`), so seeing this
 * form needs `presale:activity:read` and saving it needs `presale:activity:write`.
