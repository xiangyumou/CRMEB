/**
 * Where the presale domain attaches to an order.
 *
 * There is no "buy a presale" endpoint. Buying *is* placing an order, so the
 * storefront calls B1's `POST /api/v1/orders` with `kind: 'presale'` and
 * `kindMeta: { activityId }`, and everything here hangs off the frozen seams in
 * `order/ports.ts`. A second checkout path would be a second copy of stock,
 * coupons, freight and idempotency — which is exactly what legacy had, and why
 * `StoreAdvanceServices` and `StoreOrderServices` disagreed about stock.
 *
 * The rule that decides the design: **presale stock is its own counter.** A
 * campaign selling 500 units of a product that has 10 000 in the warehouse must
 * stop at 500, and the two counters move together in one transaction — A's
 * `StockPort` takes the SKU's, this file takes the campaign's. Four counters
 * move on a sale and all four come back on a cancel or a refund (REFUND-002,
 * QUEUE-008), which is why every movement is written to `presale_stock_ledger`:
 * `UNIQUE (order_id, reason)` makes each direction happen at most once however
 * often the effect ledger retries.
 *
 * Deposit presale is refused, not half-built. See `presale.rules.ts`.
