/**
 * `safeFetch` over a real socket and a real TLS handshake (CR-11-k).
 *
 * Every other `safeFetch` test injects its transport, so none of them ever
 * opened a connection — which is how "every https import fails certificate
 * validation" shipped: the old code dialled `https://93.184.216.34/…`, and a
 * certificate names hosts, not addresses.
 *
 * Here the servers present certificates that name **DNS names only** (no IP
 * SAN, like a real CDN's), for names that do not exist in any DNS
 * (`*.shop.test`). The resolver seam answers them with a loopback address and
 * the address rules are relaxed for loopback, the one thing a real-socket test
 * can reach. So a success proves all of it at once:
 *
 * - the socket went to the judged address (the name has no DNS answer to go
 *   anywhere else — no second lookup happened);
 * - SNI carried the name (the server records it);
 * - the certificate was validated against the name, with verification on.
