/**
 * Media-library atoms.
 *
 * The old system had one `上传图片` checkbox covering the library, the folders
 * and the delete button. Deleting is not the same act as uploading — a content
 * editor needs `write`, only a manager needs `delete` — so they are separate
 * atoms here, and the folder tree is separate again.
 *
 * There is deliberately **no atom for the storefront upload endpoint**: a
 * shopper is not an admin and holds no atoms. That endpoint is guarded by
 * `auth: 'user'`, a purpose whitelist and a per-user rate limit instead.
 *
 * These names are what `packages/contracts/src/storage/*.contract.ts` already
 * declares; the two must agree or `handle()` refuses the route at boot.
