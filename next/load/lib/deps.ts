/**
 * `next/load` is a directory of scripts, not a workspace package, so it has no
 * dependencies of its own. Every dependency is resolved *as if*
 * imported from `@shop/e2e-admin`, which already depends on `@shop/core`,
 * `@shop/db`, `@shop/testing`, `pg` and `tsx` — and the scripts run through
 * that package's `tsx`:
 *
 *     pnpm --filter @shop/e2e-admin exec tsx ../../load/run.ts
 *
 * A static `import '@shop/core/…'` from this directory would not resolve (there
 * is no `next/load/node_modules`), hence the dynamic import through a
 * `require.resolve` anchored at the e2e package.
