/**
 * Removes the bytes of attachments that were deleted long enough ago.
 *
 * Deleting from the media library tombstones the row and leaves the object
 * alone, because a product description written years ago may still point at the
 * URL. This is the second half, and it runs nightly at 03:40 — staggered away
 * from `system.pruneSessions` (03:20) and `system.pruneAuditLogs` (03:50) so
 * three housekeeping jobs do not hit the database in the same minute.
 *
 * It replaces the old `clearPoster`, which deleted **by directory listing**: it
 * walked `public/uploads/routine/` and removed anything older than a day
 * whether or not a record pointed at it. Here the database is the only
 * authority, and `storage.orphanRetentionDays: 0` turns the job off entirely.
