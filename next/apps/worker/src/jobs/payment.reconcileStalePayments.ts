/**
 * Asks the gateway about every attempt that has sat in a non-final state.
 *
 * The one job in this stream that exists purely because *a notification can be
 * lost*. A deploy, a network blip or one 500 is enough, and WeChat gives up
 * retrying after a day — after which a shop that only learns about money from
 * callbacks has a paid order it thinks is unpaid, and a buyer whose goods never
 * ship. Nothing else in the system would ever notice.
 *
 * It re-derives the ledger by querying the frozen `out_trade_no`, never by
 * elapsed time, and it includes healthy-looking `submitted` rows rather than
 * only `unknown` ones, because a lost notification leaves no trace on the row
 * it belonged to.
 *
 * Safe to run beside a live callback for the same attempt: both settle through
 * the same conditional update, so the loser books nothing and logs a replay
 * (PAYC-002).
