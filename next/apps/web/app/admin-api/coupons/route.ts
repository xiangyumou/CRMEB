/**
 * `/admin-api/coupons` — the campaign list and the create form.
 *
 * The directory mirrors the URL because App Router derives one from the other,
 * so an admin route lives under `app/admin-api/<resource>/`, not under a
 * folder named after the domain. See `docs/rewrite/cr/CR-1-golden.md`.
 *
 * A route file does three things and no more: name the contract, call one
 * service function, and (for a write) say what was acted on for the audit log.
 * No validation — `handle()` has already parsed `query`, `params` and `body`
 * against the contract; no try/catch — a `DomainError` is already the right
 * status and message; no mapping — the service returns the wire shape.
