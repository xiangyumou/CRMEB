/**
 * `/admin-api/notifications/stream` — the header bell's SSE feed.
 *
 * ## Why this is a bare route handler
 *
 * `handle()` validates a response against a zod schema and serialises it as
 * JSON. An SSE response is a `text/event-stream` body that never ends, so it
 * cannot be modelled by a `RouteDef` and cannot go through `handle` — the same
 * reason P0-b's hook uses a raw `EventSource` instead of `callRoute`. It is one
 * of exactly three bare handlers in this stream's scope, and it repeats only
 * the cookie lookup, not the authorisation rules.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It does **not** decide who may see what. The fan-out already resolved the
 * recipients against each event's permission atom (`findAdminRecipients`) and
 * published to those admins' channels only, so an operator without
 * `refund:request:read` has nothing on their channel to filter out. A filter
 * here would be a second place to get the same rule right.
 *
 * ## Keep-alive
 *
 * A comment line every 25 seconds. Without it a proxy with a 30 s idle timeout
 * closes the connection, the browser reconnects, and a shop behind nginx sees a
 * reconnect storm that looks exactly like an outage.

/**
 * The session is re-checked on every keep-alive tick and the stream closes
 * when it no longer resolves; every stream in the process shares one Redis
 * subscriber, and an admin may hold at most `MAX_STREAMS_PER_ADMIN` (CR-15-k2).
 * The stream lives in `_stream.ts` so a test can shorten the tick.
