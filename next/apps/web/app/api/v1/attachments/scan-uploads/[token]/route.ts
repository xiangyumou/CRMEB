/**
 * `/api/v1/attachments/scan-uploads/:token` — the phone's half of 扫码上传.
 *
 * Public by contract, because the phone that scanned the code has no session:
 * the token *is* the authorisation. So it is claimed by an atomic Redis script
 * before anything is stored, exactly once, and the attachment is attributed to
 * the admin who minted it rather than to nobody.
 *
 * The body is handed over as a reader, not read here: `scanUpload` spends the
 * per-address and per-code budgets and checks the code first, so a stranger
 * cannot make the server parse multipart bodies as fast as it can send them
 * (CR-12-k).
