/**
 * Nothing a test file schedules outlives the file.
 *
 * The unit suite runs under happy-dom, but vitest only lifts DOM names onto the
 * global: `setTimeout`, `setInterval` and `setImmediate` stay Node's. Every
 * component file leaves some of them pending when its last test ends (antd's
 * motion and debounce timers, React's scheduler, which drives itself through
 * `setImmediate`): `diy/panels` leaves ~160, `product-editor` 12,
 * `virtual-cards` 8. The environment is torn down in the worker's stop path
 * (`window`, `document` and the rest deleted from the global) while vitest's
 * `uncaughtException` listener is still installed. A leftover that fires
 * after that and reaches React calls `resolveUpdatePriority()`, which reads
 * `window.event` and throws `ReferenceError: window is not defined`. If that
 * happens before the worker reports `stopped`, the run fails on whichever file
 * it was. On an idle machine the stop path finishes before a timer gets a turn.
 * Under turbo, with `next build` competing for the CPU, it sometimes does not.
 * Four streams saw the failure, each time on a different file with leftover
 * timers. K2 could not reproduce it in 28 local turbo runs, but did show that
 * such a callback throws exactly that error (docs/rewrite/status/k2.md §5).
 *
 * So this file hands out tracked timers. It is listed first in `setupFiles`,
 * so it runs before anything imports React and the scheduler captures
 * `setImmediate`. It cancels every timer still pending after the file's last
 * hook, and it refuses to run a callback once the environment is gone. Timers
 * a test cares about have fired, or been awaited, long before `afterAll`; the
 * ones cancelled here are leftovers nobody was waiting for.
 * `vi.useFakeTimers()` still works: it swaps these globals out and puts them
 * back.
