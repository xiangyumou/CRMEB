/**
 * MUT-001 in `docs/invariants.md` needs a test that `pnpm guards` can resolve,
 * and the proof itself is a script (`pnpm --filter @shop/guards mutations`),
 * which runs nightly because it takes minutes and a database. This file checks
 * the catalogue on every PR, statically, so that it cannot rot between runs:
 *
 *  - it still names the ten protections MUT-001 lists, once each;
 *  - every mutant still applies. The search text occurs exactly once in the
 *    live file, so a refactor that moves a protection fails here, not at 3 a.m.;
 *  - every guarding test still exists: the file, and its `describe` title
 *    written in it.
 *
 * Whether each mutant is **killed** is the script's question, not this file's.
