/**
 * "Every URL the admin client can call resolves to a registered route."
 *
 * The admin UI calls `callRoute(routeDef, …)` and the URL is *derived* from the
 * contract, so the property is true by construction and what is left to guard
 * is the construction itself. (An admin that builds URLs as strings needs a
 * parser for every `url:` literal and still only sees the literals; this one
 * never has to.)
 *
 *   1. no API path literal outside the api seam — a hand-built `/admin-api/…`
 *      string is a URL no contract checks, which can drift from the route it
 *      meant;
 *   2. no `fetch(` in a page or a component — data goes through the generated
 *      hooks, and the one allowed caller is `call-route.ts` itself.
 *
 * Together those two mean every reachable admin URL came out of a `RouteDef`,
 * which the contracts check has already matched to a route file.

/**
 * The one URL the admin UI is allowed to build by hand, and why.
 *
 * A server-sent-event stream has no request body and no response body, so
 * `RouteDef` cannot describe it and `callRoute` cannot call it — P0-B recorded
 * this as the single exception (`status/p0b.md`), and N1 shipped the server
 * end as a bare handler for the same reason (`checks/contracts.ts`,
 * `UNCONTRACTED`, which also asserts that handler authenticates by itself).
 *
 * A decision, not a debt: it is listed so that it stays single and stays in
 * the one file that owns it. Exactly compared — if nothing builds the URL any
 * more, or if the URL grows a contract (and so could go through the seam like
 * everything else), the entry fails until it is deleted.
