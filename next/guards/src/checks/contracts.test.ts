 * ROUTE-001 in `docs/rewrite/invariants.md`: "every registered route resolves to
 * a real handler, and nothing else is reachable".
 *
 * The check itself is what asserts it; this file is the test id the ledger can
 * point at, and it splits the check's findings by direction so a failure names
 * which half broke. Both halves matter and they fail differently: a contract
 * with no route file is a 404 on a URL the client believes in, and a route file
 * with no contract is a handler nobody validates, authorises or audits.
