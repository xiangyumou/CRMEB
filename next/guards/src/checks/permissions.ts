/**
 * Three facts about the permission set, checked against each other:
 *
 *   1. every `auth: 'admin'` route names an atom that `permissions.ts` declares
 *      (`defineRoute` already refuses a route with no atom at all, so what is
 *      left to catch is a *typo* — an atom nobody declares can never be granted,
 *      which locks the screen for everybody including the super admin);
 *   2. every menu entry's atom is declared, or the entry is invisible for ever;
 *   3. no atom is unused — an atom no route and no menu entry names is a
 *      checkbox in the role editor that grants nothing, which is how legacy's
 *      商品保障 ended up hidden inside the 商品参数 group (CAT-016).
 *
 * The implicit atoms every admin holds (`auth:profile:*`) are exempt from (3):
 * they are granted by `IMPLICIT_ADMIN_PERMISSIONS`, not by a role.
